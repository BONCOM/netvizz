A collection of scripts that help with downloading data from the Facebook platform for research purposes.

This is relatively easy to set up. You need a server enironment running PHP (no database involved), put the files in a directory, head over to https://developers.facebook.com/, create a new app that points toward the directory, make sure that there is a writable folder called "data" in your directory. That's it.
